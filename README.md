This is a simple [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) service provider for making it easy to include the official
[AWS SDK for PHP](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php) in your Laravel and Lumen applications.

This README is for version 3.x of the service provider, which is implemented to work with Version 3 of the AWS SDK for
PHP and Laravel 5.1.

**Major Versions:**

* **3.x** (YOU ARE HERE) - For `laravel/framework:~5.1|~6.0|~7.0` and `aws/aws-sdk-php:~3.0`
* **2.x** ([2.0 branch](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php-laravel/tree/2.0)) - For `laravel/framework:5.0.*` and `aws/aws-sdk-php:~2.4`
* **1.x** ([1.0 branch](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php-laravel/tree/1.0)) - For `laravel/framework:4.*` and `aws/aws-sdk-php:~2.4`

## Installation

The AWS Service Provider can be installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) by requiring the
`aws/aws-sdk-php-laravel` package in your project's `composer.json`.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "aws/aws-sdk-php-laravel": "~3.0"
    }
}
```

Then run a composer update
```sh
php composer.phar update
```

To use the AWS Service Provider, you must register the provider when bootstrapping your application.


### Lumen
In Lumen find the `Register Service Providers` in your `bootstrap/app.php` and register the AWS Service Provider.

```php
    $app->register(Aws\Laravel\AwsServiceProvider::class);
```

### Laravel
In Laravel find the `providers` key in your `config/app.php` and register the AWS Service Provider.

```php
    'providers' => array(
        // ...
        Aws\Laravel\AwsServiceProvider::class,
    )
```

Find the `aliases` key in your `config/app.php` and add the AWS facade alias.

```php
    'aliases' => array(
        // ...
        'AWS' => Aws\Laravel\AwsFacade::class,
    )
```

## Configuration

By default, the package uses the following environment variables to auto-configure the plugin without modification:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION (default = us-east-1)
```

To customize the configuration file, publish the package configuration using Artisan.

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish  --provider="Aws\Laravel\AwsServiceProvider"
```

The settings can be found in the generated `config/aws.php` configuration file. By default, the credentials and region settings will pull from your `.env` file.

```php
return [
    'credentials' => [
        'key'    => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', ''),
        'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', ''),
    ],
    'region' => env('AWS_REGION', 'us-east-1'),
    'version' => 'latest',
    
    // You can override settings for specific services
    'Ses' => [
        'region' => 'us-east-1',
    ],
];
```

Note that you can always delete the `credentials` line from this file if you'd like to use the [default SDK Configuration Provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/guide_credentials.html#default-credential-chain) instead.

Referring Laravel 5.2.0 [Upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/upgrade#upgrade-5.2.0), you must using configâ€¨
file instead of environment variable option if using php artisan `config:cache`.

Learn more about [configuring the SDK](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/guide/guide/configuration.html) on
the SDK's User Guide.

## Usage

In order to use the AWS SDK for PHP within your app, you need to retrieve it from the [Laravel Service
Container](https://laravel.com/docs/container#binding). The following example uses the Amazon S3 client to upload a file.

```php
$s3 = App::make('aws')->createClient('s3');
$s3->putObject(array(
    'Bucket'     => 'YOUR_BUCKET',
    'Key'        => 'YOUR_OBJECT_KEY',
    'SourceFile' => '/the/path/to/the/file/you/are/uploading.ext',
));
```

If the AWS facade is registered within the `aliases` section of the application configuration, you can also use the
following technique.

```php
$s3 = AWS::createClient('s3');
$s3->putObject(array(
    'Bucket'     => 'YOUR_BUCKET',
    'Key'        => 'YOUR_OBJECT_KEY',
    'SourceFile' => '/the/path/to/the/file/you/are/uploading.ext',
));
```
